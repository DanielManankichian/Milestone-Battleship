# Milestone-Battleship

This Game was made by Daniel Manankichian For SDSU's Milestone 1 project

Welcome to battleship, a game all about strategy. You and your opponent each have five ships. Place your ships on the board and press "Start Game". The computer's ships are hidden from you so you must find and destroy all five of their ships before they destroy yours.
